                    <p class="mb-2"> Having accumulated a wealth of experience across various roles in the public service sector, I've cultivated a deep sense of empathy, compassion, and a genuine enjoyment of engaging with the public. My passion for aiding others always took precedence over salary considerations. In September 2020, seeking a change of pace and environment, I relocated from New York to Arizona. Securing a position with the State of Arizona, my aspiration to advance was hindered by downsizing, prompting me to take a bold step by leaving my public service role. During my job search, Liberty Mutual's recruiter presented an opportunity to join the Commercial Claims Department, a field I hadn't previously considered. Intrigued by the chance to learn something new, I embraced the challenge and was hired. My enthusiasm for growth led me to explore better opportunities, with my supervisor recognizing my eye for detail and analytical skills, guiding me towards becoming a Claims Adjuster. Amidst this exploration, an American Express recruiter offered a unique chance to become an Insurance Claims Adjuster, generously covering testing and license fees. Eager to embrace the opportunity, I obtained my Property and Casualty License within 30 days.</p>

                    <p class="mb-2">Securing my Property and Casualty License ignited a newfound passion within me, unveiling a reservoir of confidence I didn't realize I had lost while settling into a routine life. The realization that I could obtain this license became a catalyst for positive change, propelling me to re-enroll in school. To my surprise, I discovered that I was only a few credits away from completing my bachelor's degree—a goal I had been diligently working towards for over two decades. Life's demands had momentarily taken precedence, but taking the risk to obtain my license set me on a transformative path I had never envisioned. Although moments of doubt may arise, my confidence is steadily rebuilding, and the awareness of my capabilities serves as a constant source of motivation. I am now resolute in the belief that I am not only capable but destined for greater accomplishments.</p>
